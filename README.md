Good day, everyone!
I'm excited to introduce GeoBarangay AI, a cutting-edge solution that will transform how we at Davao Light handle customer data and regulatory compliance. As a leading power utility, we understand that data integrity is not just important—it’s essential. Accurate data is crucial for compliance, operational efficiency, and maintaining the trust of our customers and regulators, particularly the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC).
One of our biggest challenges has been the inaccuracy of customer barangay information, which has a major impact on classifying areas as urban, suburban, or rural. These inaccuracies affect our planning and regulatory reporting. The root of the problem is that the barangay boundaries provided by Google Maps, government sources, and our AGILA system are often inconsistent and inaccurate. This leads to errors like reporting incorrect customer numbers per barangay, compromising our ability to provide accurate and reliable reports to regulators.
GeoBarangay AI addresses this challenge head-on by using machine learning to predict the correct barangay based on customer latitude and longitude data. With an impressive accuracy rate of 99%, this solution ensures that our customer data is reliable, enabling precise classification into urban, suburban, and rural categories. We’ve trained our model on a comprehensive dataset, which allows us to provide accurate, compliant, and trustworthy reports to the ERC.
But GeoBarangay AI is not just about compliance. It’s about enhancing our entire operation. This AI solution can be applied to all our assets, such as wires, transformers, and poles, improving our asset management and operational efficiency across the board.
Furthermore, the benefits of GeoBarangay AI extend beyond Davao Light. Other electric utilities facing the same dilemma of inaccurate barangay information can adopt this solution, achieving the same high level of data accuracy and integrity. By implementing GeoBarangay AI, we are not only setting a new standard for excellence in our operations but also providing a model that others in the industry can follow..
By embracing GeoBarangay AI, Davao Light is taking a decisive step towards ensuring data accuracy, regulatory compliance, and operational excellence. We're not just solving a problem; we're upholding the highest standards of integrity in our operations and setting a benchmark for others to follow. Thank you for your time, and let's continue to uphold integrity and excellence together!
